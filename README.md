# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python.

## Description

The code performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Loads customer data from a CSV file.
3. Performs data exploration and preprocessing.
4. Selects features for clustering.
5. Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
6. Applies K-Means clustering to group customers.
7. Visualizes the clusters and centroids.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Python script.

## Results

The code generates a scatter plot visualizing the customer segments based on their annual income and spending score.
